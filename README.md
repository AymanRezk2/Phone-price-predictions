# ðŸ“± Creativa-Project â€“ Phone Price Prediction

A **Machine Learning project** focused on predicting smartphone prices based on technical specifications.  
I handled **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, and implemented multiple models to find the best performance.

### What I did:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Removed missing values, handled outliers, and prepared the dataset for training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created and optimized features to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Model Training**: Compared three different ML models:
  - **Decision Trees**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **XGBoost**
- **Cross-Validation**: Used to validate model performance and ensure consistent results.

**Outcome:** Achieved reliable predictions through proper preprocessing, model tuning, and evaluation. This project improved my understanding of the **ML pipeline**, from raw data to actionable results.
