# ðŸ“± Creativa-Project â€“ Phone Price Prediction

Predicting **smartphone prices** using pure ML power!  
I worked on **data cleaning**, handled messy datasets, and did some **feature engineering** to squeeze more insights out of the data.  
Tested **three different models**:
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**

Used **cross-validation** to double-check the results and make sure the predictions hold up.  
A fun dive into **model comparison, feature tweaking, and hands-on ML practice**!
